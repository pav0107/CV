## Pav Rao

I’m a junior full stack developer looking for a role in a company whose products or services excite me; where I feel I can make a valuable contribution to the team. I also want to be somewhere that will allow me to continue the steep learning curve I’m currently on at Makers Academy, an intensive 16-week coding bootcamp.

Prior to Makers, I graduated with a degree in Physics with Astrophysics, enjoyed a career as an advertising creative/copywriter and performed stand-up comedy to audiences of up to 400 in places such as London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Vienna and Budapest.

## Work Experience

**Advertising/Copywriting** (2006 - 2021)  

- Any experience, including roles and responsibilities and results achived in bullet point format.
- During my career I’ve had permanent roles and freelanced at a variety of companies, from big London ad agencies to design boutiques to branding studios to fundraising agencies to in-house creative teams.
- I have experience in TV, posters, press, digital, documentary film, T-shirts, leaflets, events, letters, radio and video.
- I’ve worked with clients ranging in size from individuals to large multinationals, such as Nokia and Honda.
- I’ve collaborated with creative directors, designers, typographers, photographers, illustrators, animators, film directors, account handlers and clients to achieve the best results.
- I’ve got experience in line-management, had autonomy over projects, had to work out solutions to problems as they occurred, and managed my own time to make sure concurrent projects got done. 
- When I freelanced, I proactively approached clients to get work out for them.
- As an advertising creative it was my job to find creative solutions to business problems, looking for unusual connections to grab attention and resonate with consumers. For more detail on the work I did, please view my LinkedIn profile as well as my portfolio website where I outline the business problem I was given and my approach to solving it.
- For a more detailed look please check out my LinkedIn profile.


**Stand-up comedy** (2011 onwards)  

- I’ve gigged across the UK and in Europe to audiences of up to 400 people. 
- In 2017 I was a semi-finalist in the BBC New Comedy Awards.
- In 2016 I won the Bath Comedy Festival’s New Act of the Year Competition.
- I believe much of what I do in stand-up will help in my career as a software engineer: 
  - Find unusual and surprising connections.
  - Look at familiar things and situations from a fresh angle.
  - Think on my feet.
  - Not be afraid to try something that might fail, dust myself off, learn lessons, then try again.
  - Think about the bigger picture of what I'm trying to do (narrative arc, in terms of stand-up) as well as the granular detail (specific word choices)
  - Be able to take feedback (hopefully not quite as brutally given as the audience in the nightclub I played in Bournemouth!)
