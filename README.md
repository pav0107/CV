## Pav Rao

I’m a junior full stack developer looking for a role in a company whose products or services excite me; where I feel I can make a valuable contribution to the team. I also want to be somewhere that will allow me to continue the steep learning curve I’m currently on at Makers Academy, an intensive 16-week coding bootcamp.

Prior to Makers, I graduated with a degree in Physics with Astrophysics, enjoyed a career as an advertising creative/copywriter and performed stand-up comedy to audiences of up to 400 in places such as London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Vienna and Budapest.

## Work Experience

**Advertising/Copywriting** (2006 - 2021)  

- Any experience, including roles and responsibilities and results achived in bullet point format.
- During my career I’ve had permanent roles and freelanced at a variety of companies, from big London ad agencies to design boutiques to branding studios to fundraising agencies to in-house creative teams.
- I have experience in TV, posters, press, digital, documentary film, T-shirts, leaflets, events, letters, radio and video.
- I’ve worked with clients ranging in size from individuals to large multinationals, such as Nokia and Honda.
- I’ve collaborated with creative directors, designers, typographers, photographers, illustrators, animators, film directors, account handlers and clients to achieve the best results.
- I’ve got experience in line-management, had autonomy over projects, had to work out solutions to problems as they occurred, and managed my own time to make sure concurrent projects got done. 
- When I freelanced, I proactively approached clients to get work out for them.
- As an advertising creative it was my job to find creative solutions to business problems, looking for unusual connections to grab attention and resonate with consumers. For more detail on the work I did, please view my LinkedIn profile as well as my portfolio website where I outline the business problem I was given and my approach to solving it.
- For a more detailed look please check out my LinkedIn profile.



**Stand-up comedy** (2011 onwards)  

- I’ve gigged across the UK and in Europe to audiences of up to 400 people. 
- In 2017 I was a semi-finalist in the BBC New Comedy Awards.
- In 2016 I won the Bath Comedy Festival’s New Act of the Year Competition.
- I believe much of what I do in stand-up will help in my career as a software engineer: 
  - Find unusual and surprising connections.
  - Look at familiar things and situations from a fresh angle.
  - Think on my feet.
  - Not be afraid to try something that might fail, dust myself off, learn lessons, then try again.
  - Think about the bigger picture of what I'm trying to do (narrative arc, in terms of stand-up) as well as the granular detail (specific word choices)
  - Be able to take feedback (hopefully not quite as brutally given as the audience in the nightclub I played in Bournemouth!)

#### Professional references from my career as a copywriter, which can be seen on LinkedIn: ####

“Working with Pav was fantastic - we are only a small charity and the pro-bono help that he has given us has been wonderful. He listened to our thoughts and creatively incorporated them into his suggestions. He has also stayed with us, volunteering his time, throughout a daunting process of taking the creatives through to reality. Thanks Pav!”
_Julia Lalla-Maharajh OBE, Founder of Orchid Project_

“I've worked with many writers over the years, few are as good as Pav. He combines razor sharp ideas, with a work ethic that many senior people could learn a great deal from. He's a rare talent. I couldn't recommend him highly enough.”
_Peter Henshaw, Managing Director/ Digital Technologist / Cannes Lions Judge_

“Pav is one of those creatives who you beg the creative director to put on your brief. He's charming to be around and full of great ideas. He has a solution to any obstacle you throw at him, no matter how ridiculous (and they can be crazy requests) but Pav always takes feedback in stride and works with you to develop the best work possible. I would 100% recommend Pav, he is a real asset to any team.”
_Chiya Louie, Client Services Director, Head of Sport at Bright Partnership_

“Pav is smart, ideas-oriented and easy to work with. He has a calmness about him that I have really valued, especially when things are busy. He's interested in the world around him, which makes a difference in a copywriter, works hard and is a gracious team member.”
_Karin Weatherup, Supporter insight digger and creative director - fundraising_
