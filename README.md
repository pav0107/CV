## WORK EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS

### Advertising Creative/Copywriter (2006 - 2021)

- **Problem-solving** was integral to being a successful advertising creative. It was my job to find creative solutions to business problems, looking for unusual connections to grab attention and resonate with consumers.
- **Adaptability** has also been a key feature, due to the breadth and depth of my career. I’ve had both permanent and freelance roles at big London ad agencies, design studios, branding agencies, fundraising agencies and in-house creative teams. I have experience in TV, posters, press, digital, documentary film, T-shirts, leaflets, events, letters, radio and video. I’ve also worked with clients ranging in size from individuals to large multinationals, such as Nokia and Honda.
- **Collaboration** has been key in producing the best work possible. I’ve worked closely with creative directors, designers, typographers, photographers, illustrators, animators, film directors, account handlers, project managers and clients. 
- **Communication** has played a central role in my advertising career. I've engaged with, presented to, and sold in ideas to clients. And as is the nature of the business, I've had to think long and hard about the language and tone of voice I use, depending on the audience and product or service. When I worked at Macmillan Cancer Support, I presented workshops on copywriting and co-presented workshops on branding, consistently receiving excellent feedback.

### Stand-up comedy (2011 onwards)

- **Resilience** has been important to the success I've had. In 2017 I was a semi-finalist in the BBC New Comedy Awards (You can see the set I did in the heats on my [stand-up site](http://pavrao.com/)). And in 2016 I won the Bath Comedy Festival’s New Act of the Year Competition. But I've also performed to near silence, and have even had people walk off. My successes are mostly down to not being afraid to try something that might fail, dusting myself off, learning lessons, then trying again.
- **Public speaking** wasn't always a strong point. But I’ve gigged across the UK and in Europe to audiences of up to 400 people. And I've also gigged in front of small and hostile crowds too so, by comparison, it's difficult to get nervous about public speaking!
- **Creativity** is at the heart of great stand-up. I look at familiar things and situations from a fresh angle. I find unusual and surprising connections. I think on my feet.

<!-- ## SKILLS

#### Adaptability

In my first job as an advertising creative/writer I was tasked with leading in the creation of a documentary on music torture for human rights charity Reprieve. I had precisely zero experience of making documentary films. 

I threw myself into it, doing tonnes of research and creating a structure to tell a compelling story. I also made sure I crafted the right questions for people I would interview. I had precisely zero experience in conducting interviews. 

I ended up interviewing Tony Benn, Robert Del Naja (Massive Attack), Philippe Sands QC (Professor of Law at UCL), Dr William Hopkins (consultant psychiatrist at the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture), Moazzam Begg (former prisoner at Guantanamo Bay), Ruhal Ahmed (former prisoner at Guantanamo Bay) and Christopher Arendt (former guard at Guantanamo Bay). Thankfully, the interviews went really well, I had tonnes of great material to work with and my boss was happy. 

#### Initiative

I'm always looking to be pro-active. As an example, I approached Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) with the art-director I was working with, to see if we could help on any projects. They asked if we could come up with a stunt for their Global Day of Action on Military Spending on 15th April. We provided them with a selection of ideas, one of which they developed.

The stunt took place outside the Houses of Parliament and featured protestors from CAAT, CND, Disarm DSEi and Pax Christi. You can see a video of the event [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_1FtEY-gp0).

#### Attention to detail

As a copywriter I was used to sweating over not just how sentences were phrased, but individual words too, because I knew the difference it made. 

In stand-up, feedback is instant and crystal clear. I became acutely aware that even the way I intonated a _single_ word meant the diffence between getting a laugh and not, so I'm used to paying incredibly close attention to even the smallest of details.

#### Big picture thinking

In both advertising and stand-up everything started with the big idea. I knew that time spent properly here made the biggest difference down the line. I could get past the obvious thoughts and into more original, fertile territory. Details are vital, but the phrase 'polishing a turd' is well-known in adland for a reason.

## CODE REVIEWS

Makers partners with [CoGrammar](https://www.cogrammar.com/) to provide independent, external code reviews.
The following feedback was given after being set a tech test and having my process observed for 45 mins.
<details>
  <summary>Click here to view</summary>
 
  </br>
  
  **On following TDD:**

  > "You have based your tests on behaviours in order to keep your code
  > properly decoupled from the tests and this also meant that the tests were
  > client-oriented with the acceptance criteria properly encoded in the
  > algorithm."

  > "Your test progression made logical sense and you used it in order to make
  > incremental transformations to the code so that with each specific test, the
  > solution becomes more general."

  **On programming fluently:**

  > "You are very fluent with Ruby and RSpec syntax and language
  > constructs. You are also aware of built-in methods in Ruby and how to use them
  > correctly."

  **On debugging:**

  > "You have read failing test messages carefully and used the
  > information from RSpec’s failing tests well to determine what could be causing
  > problems and this helped you to make well-informed changes to fix bugs."

  > "You allowed yourself to look up documentation quickly when you
  > were not sure of syntax which allowed you to make efficient use of your
  > resources."

  **On modelling:**

  > "You chose to model your solution as a single method in a class. This
  > was a simple enough place to start and this allowed for enough functionality
  > to handle the entire problem, without over-engineering the solution. This
  > meant that you could extract methods as and when needed to adhere to the
  > single-responsibility principle."

  > "Your algorithm made logical sense and you were making great progress through
  > the exercise."

  **On having a methodical approach to solving problems:**

  > "You adhered to the red-green-refactor cycle by maintaining a
  > behaviour-first approach. You also prioritised the core and simpler cases over
  > the edge cases and more complex scenarios, allowing you to provide the client
  > with immediate value. Your tests also progressed logically, giving your
  > development cycle a sensible direction."

  > "You used research really well in your development process so that
  > you were able to avoid adding unnecessary bugs to the code."

  **On using an agile development process:**

  > You have clarified well what the requirements are for the system and
  > asked good questions about the main requirements and some common edge cases."

  **On writing code that's easy to change:**

  > "You are once again using Git commits regularly when tests pass which
  > ensures that you take advantage of having previous working versions to fall
  > back on."

  > "Your tests are again sufficiently decoupled from the code by making use of
  > tests based on the overall behaviours as were discussed by the client."

  **On justifying the way I work:**

  > "You vocalised yourself quite well. Your comments were audible and
  > you provided valid justifications for your steps. You gave a really good
  > insight as to what your thought process was as you were making decisions."
