I’m a junior full stack developer looking for a role in a company whose products or services excite me; where I feel I can make a valuable contribution to the team. I also want to be somewhere that will allow me to continue the steep learning curve I’m currently on at Makers Academy, an intensive 12-week coding bootcamp.

Prior to Makers, I graduated with a degree in Physics with Astrophysics, enjoyed a career as an advertising creative/copywriter and performed stand-up comedy to audiences of up to 400 people in places such as London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Vienna and Budapest.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

**Advertising Creative/Copywriter** (2006 - 2021)  

- During my career I’ve had permanent roles and freelanced at big London ad agencies, design studios, branding agencies, fundraising agencies and in-house creative teams.
- I have experience in TV, posters, press, digital, documentary film, T-shirts, leaflets, events, letters, radio and video.
- I’ve worked with clients ranging in size from individuals to large multinationals, such as Nokia and Honda.
- To produce the best work possible, I’ve collaborated with creative directors, designers, typographers, photographers, illustrators, animators, film directors, account handlers, project managers and clients.
- I’ve got experience in line-management, had autonomy over projects, worked out solutions to problems as they occurred, and managed my own schedule to make sure concurrent projects got completed on time. 
- When I freelanced, I proactively approached clients to get work out for them.
- As an advertising creative it was my job to find creative solutions to business problems, looking for unusual connections to grab attention and resonate with consumers. 
- For more detail on the work I did, please view my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pav-rao-0a46453b/) as well as my [advertising portfolio website](https://www.pavt.co.uk/) where I outline the business problem I was given and my approach to solving it.  
  
**Stand-up comedy** (2011 onwards)  

- I’ve gigged across the UK and in Europe to audiences of up to 400 people. 
- In 2017 I was a semi-finalist in the BBC New Comedy Awards.
  - You can see the set I did in the heats [here](https://vimeo.com/314071085). 
- In 2016 I won the Bath Comedy Festival’s New Act of the Year Competition.
- I believe much of what I do in stand-up will help in my career as a software engineer: 
  - Look at familiar things and situations from a fresh angle.
  - Find unusual and surprising connections.
  - Think on my feet.
  - Not be afraid to try something that might fail, dust myself off, learn lessons, then try again.
  - Keep in mind the bigger picture (narrative arc, in terms of stand-up) as well as the granular detail (specific word choices).
  - Be able to take feedback (hopefully not given quite as brutally as by the audience in the nightclub I played in Bournemouth!).  
  
(_I've taken a bit of a break from stand-up to establish a career as a software engineer. If/when I do go back to it, it'll very much just be as a hobby_)



## SKILLS

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?

#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)


#### Problem solver

My academic background in maths and physics, combined with my career as an advertising creative and stand-up has meant I've spent the last 25 years knee-deep in problem-solving. 

An example is a piece I worked on for a pharmaceutical client who had a stand at 2013's ESC (European Society of Cardiology) Congress, regarded as the world’s premier conference specialising in the science, management and prevention of cardiovascular disease.

The brief was to have posters along a walkway to advertise the stand. The problem with this was that getting people's attention when they're busily trying to get around was going to be almost impossible.

I thought a better idea was to use live illustration. This led to four artists creating a 60m-long illustration, live over the course of the four-day event, captured beautifully [here](https://vimeo.com/75317280)


#### Adaptable

In my first job as an advertising creative/writer I was tasked with leading in the creation of a documentary on music torture. I had precisely zero experience of making documentary films. 

I threw myself into it, doing tonnes of research, creating a narrative arc, and also made sure I had the right questions ready for interviews I would conduct. I had precisely zero experience in conducting interviews. 

I ended up interviewing Tony Benn, Robert Del Naja (Massive Attack), Philippe Sands QC (Professor of Law at UCL), Dr William Hopkins (consultant psychiatrist at the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture), Moazzam Begg (former prisoner at Guantanamo Bay), Ruhal Ahmed (former prisoner at Guantanamo Bay) and Christopher Arendt (former guard at Guantanamo Bay). And it all went well. Phew. I then did a rough cut of the interviews and pieced them together to fit the narrative arc.

#### Initiative

I'm always looking to be pro-active. As an example I approached Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) early in 2013, with art-director Pablo Videla, to see if we could help on any projects.

They asked if we could come up with a stunt for their Global Day of Action on Military Spending on 15th April. We provided them with a selection of ideas, one of which they developed.

The stunt took place outside the Houses of Parliament and featured protestors from CAAT, CND, Disarm DSEi and Pax Christi.

You can see a video of the event [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_1FtEY-gp0)

#### Communication

Through a career in advertising, and through client presentations I understand how to engage with clients and sell in an idea. An as is the nature of the business, I also understand how to talk to a wider audience, and lots of different types of audiences at that.

I used to hate public speaking when I was younger, but somehow after trying to make hundreds of people laugh, it doesn't seem like anything to be scared of any more. 

Getting the best work out also means communication with your peers and boss. I've been lucky enough to have worked with some truly brilliant people in my time and it's such a joy working with people with skillsets you don't have to create something amazing.

I've also presented workshops on copywriting when I worked at Macmillan Cancer Support, an organisation of over 1,000 people, and consistently received excellent feedback.


#### Fast learner

Hopefully something about Makers here as I should be in a position to pick up new tech quickly
