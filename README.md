I’m a junior full stack developer looking to join a company whose products or services excite me, and where I feel I can make a valuable contribution to the team. I also want to be somewhere that will allow me to continue the steep learning curve I enjoyed at Makers, an intensive 16-week coding bootcamp.

Prior to Makers, I graduated with a degree in Physics with Astrophysics, enjoyed a career as an advertising creative/copywriter and performed stand-up comedy to audiences of up to 400 people in places such as London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Vienna and Budapest.

## PROJECTS

## CODE REVIEWS
Makers partners with [CoGrammar](https://www.cogrammar.com/) to provide independent, external code reviews.
The following feedback was given after being set a tech test and having my process observed for 45 mins.

**On following TDD:**

> "You have based your tests on behaviours in order to keep your code
> properly decoupled from the tests and this also meant that the tests were
> client-oriented with the acceptance criteria properly encoded in the
> algorithm."

> "Your test progression made logical sense and you used it in order to make
> incremental transformations to the code so that with each specific test, the
> solution becomes more general."

> "You followed the RGR cycle really closely."

**On programming fluently:**

> "You are very fluent with Ruby and RSpec syntax and language
> constructs. You are also aware of built-in methods in Ruby and how to use them
> correctly."

**On debugging:**

> "You have read failing test messages carefully and used the
> information from RSpec’s failing tests well to determine what could be causing
> problems and this helped you to make well-informed changes to fix bugs."

> "You allowed yourself to look up documentation quickly when you
> were not sure of syntax which allowed you to make efficient use of your
> resources."

**On modelling:**

> "You chose to model your solution as a single method in a class. This
> was a simple enough place to start and this allowed for enough functionality
> to handle the entire problem, without over-engineering the solution. This
> meant that you could extract methods as and when needed to adhere to the
> single-responsibility principle."

> "Your algorithm made logical sense and you were making great progress through
> the exercise."

**On having a methodical approach to solving problems:**

> "You adhered to the red-green-refactor cycle by maintaining a
> behaviour-first approach. You also prioritised the core and simpler cases over
> the edge cases and more complex scenarios, allowing you to provide the client
> with immediate value. Your tests also progressed logically, giving your
> development cycle a sensible direction."

> "You used research really well in your development process so that
> you were able to avoid adding unnecessary bugs to the code."

**On using an agile development process:**

> You have clarified well what the requirements are for the system and
> asked good questions about the main requirements and some common edge cases.
> The question about the dictionary was a logical and insightful question given
> the problem domain."

**On writing code that's easy to change:**

> "You are once again using Git commits regularly when tests pass which
> ensures that you take advantage of having previous working versions to fall
> back on."

> "Your tests are again sufficiently decoupled from the code by making use of
> tests based on the overall behaviours as were discussed by the client."

**On justifying the way I work:**

> "You vocalised yourself quite well. Your comments were audible and
> you provided valid justifications for your steps. You gave a really good
> insight as to what your thought process was as you were making decisions."



## WORK EXPERIENCE

**Advertising Creative/Copywriter** (2006 - 2021)  

- As an advertising creative it was my job to find creative solutions to business problems, looking for unusual connections to grab attention and resonate with consumers. 
- During my career, I’ve had permanent roles and freelanced at big London ad agencies, design studios, branding agencies, fundraising agencies and in-house creative teams.
- I have experience in TV, posters, press, digital, documentary film, T-shirts, leaflets, events, letters, radio and video.
- I’ve worked with clients ranging in size from individuals to large multinationals, such as Nokia and Honda.
- To produce the best work possible, I’ve collaborated with creative directors, designers, typographers, photographers, illustrators, animators, film directors, account handlers, project managers and clients.
- I’ve got experience in line-management, had autonomy over projects, worked out solutions to problems as they occurred, and managed my own schedule to make sure concurrent projects got completed on time. 
- When I freelanced, I proactively approached clients to get work out for them.
- For more information on my work, please view my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pav-rao-0a46453b/) as well as my [advertising portfolio website](https://www.pavt.co.uk/), where I outline the business problem I was given and my approach to solving it.  
  
**Stand-up comedy** (2011 onwards)  

- I’ve gigged across the UK and in Europe to audiences of up to 400 people. 
- In 2017 I was a semi-finalist in the BBC New Comedy Awards.
  - You can see the set I did in the heats [here](https://vimeo.com/314071085). 
- In 2016 I won the Bath Comedy Festival’s New Act of the Year Competition.
- I believe much of what I do in stand-up will help in my career as a software engineer: 
  - Look at familiar things and situations from a fresh angle.
  - Find unusual and surprising connections.
  - Think on my feet.
  - Not be afraid to try something that might fail, dust myself off, learn lessons, then try again.
  - Keep in mind the bigger picture (narrative arc, in terms of stand-up) as well as the granular detail (specific word choices).
  - Be able to take feedback (hopefully not given quite as brutally as by the audience in the nightclub I played in Bournemouth!).  
  
(_I've taken a bit of a break from stand-up to establish a career as a software engineer. If/when I do go back to it, it'll very much just be as a hobby_)



## SKILLS

#### Problem-solving

My academic background in maths and physics, combined with my careers as an advertising creative and stand-up comedian means I've spent the last 25 years knee-deep in problem-solving. 

An example is a piece I worked on for a pharmaceutical client who had a stand at 2013's ESC (European Society of Cardiology) Congress, regarded as the world’s premier conference specialising in the science, management and prevention of cardiovascular disease.

The brief was to create posters that went along a walkway to advertise the stand. I made the case that the key problem with this was that it was going to be almost impossible to get people's attention when they're busily trying to get around.

I thought a better idea, to get around this, but which at the time went beyond the scope of the brief, was to use live illustration. I pushed quite hard for this concept, which eventually led to four artists creating a 60m-long illustration, live over the course of the four-day event, captured [here](https://vimeo.com/75317280).

#### Communication

Throughout my career in advertising I've engaged with, presented to, and sold in ideas to clients. And as is the nature of the business, I've had to think long and hard about the language and tone of voice I use, depending on the audience and product or service.

It's impossible to produce great work without a solid working relationship with your colleagues and boss. I've been lucky enough to have worked with some truly brilliant people in my time and it's such a joy to help create work that's better than what any one person could have brought to the table.

When I worked at Macmillan Cancer Support, I presented workshops on copywriting and co-presented workshops on branding, consistently receiving excellent feedback.

#### Adaptability

In my first job as an advertising creative/writer I was tasked with leading in the creation of a documentary on music torture for human rights charity Reprieve. I had precisely zero experience of making documentary films. 

I threw myself into it, doing tonnes of research and creating a structure to tell a compelling story. I also made sure I crafted the right questions for people I would interview. I had precisely zero experience in conducting interviews. 

I ended up interviewing Tony Benn, Robert Del Naja (Massive Attack), Philippe Sands QC (Professor of Law at UCL), Dr William Hopkins (consultant psychiatrist at the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture), Moazzam Begg (former prisoner at Guantanamo Bay), Ruhal Ahmed (former prisoner at Guantanamo Bay) and Christopher Arendt (former guard at Guantanamo Bay). Thankfully, the interviews went really well, I had tonnes of great material to work with and my boss was happy. 

#### Initiative

I'm always looking to be pro-active. As an example, I approached Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) with the art-director I was working with, to see if we could help on any projects. They asked if we could come up with a stunt for their Global Day of Action on Military Spending on 15th April. We provided them with a selection of ideas, one of which they developed.

The stunt took place outside the Houses of Parliament and featured protestors from CAAT, CND, Disarm DSEi and Pax Christi. You can see a video of the event [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_1FtEY-gp0).

#### Attention to detail

As a copywriter I was used to sweating over not just how sentences were phrased, but individual words too, because I knew the difference it made. 

In stand-up, feedback is instant and crystal clear. I became acutely aware that even the way I intonated a _single_ word meant the diffence between getting a laugh and not, so I'm used to paying incredibly close attention to even the smallest of details.

#### Big picture thinking

In both advertising and stand-up everything started with the big idea. I knew that time spent properly here made the biggest difference down the line. I could get past the obvious thoughts and into more original, fertile territory. Details are vital, but the phrase 'polishing a turd' is well-known in adland for a reason.

<!-- #### Fast learning
