## Pav Rao

I’m a junior full stack developer looking for a role in a company whose products or services excite me; where I feel I can make a valuable contribution to the team. I also want to be somewhere that will allow me to continue the steep learning curve I’m currently on at Makers Academy, an intensive 16-week coding bootcamp.

Prior to Makers, I graduated with a degree in Physics with Astrophysics, enjoyed a career as an advertising creative/copywriter and performed stand-up comedy to audiences of up to 400 in places such as London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Vienna and Budapest.
